Yet Another Dominion

Let us play Dominion together!

My objective is to provide an interface to support IA coding for Dominion. 
When I'm done, I would like to be able to build rules like "If you have enough money, buy a gold".
Once I've done that, I will propose to play a couple of games with my friend Loic.

This project is also created to teach me TDD. If you want to contribute, please make sure that your code
is 99% covered with unit test. I would like it to be 100%, but I don't know how to test properly the calls
to Collections.shuffle

Enjoy!
